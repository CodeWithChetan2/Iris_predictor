# Iris_predictor

Here's a brief description of each component:

1. **Static/css Folder:**
   - This folder contains the CSS files necessary for styling your web interface. Ensure that the styling is applied correctly to your HTML templates.

2. **Templates Folder:**
   - This folder contains the HTML template(s) for your web interface. `index.html` is the main template where users will interact with your Iris classification model.

3. **irisfastapp.py:**
   - This is your FastAPI backend server script. It should define the routes and endpoints required for your application, including handling requests for making predictions using the Iris classification model.

4. **iris.ipynb:**
   - This Jupyter Notebook contains the code you've written for building and training your Iris classification model. You may have used libraries like scikit-learn for this purpose. Make sure the model is properly trained and saved.

5. **requirements.txt:**
   - This file lists the project dependencies, including FastAPI, scikit-learn, and any other Python packages you have used. You can generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you're using virtual environments.

6. **README.md:**
   - This file serves as project documentation and provides instructions on how to set up and run your project. Include details on how to start the FastAPI server, access the web interface, and any other relevant information.

**Workflow:**

1. Ensure that your `iris.ipynb` notebook has a well-trained Iris classification model. Save the model so that it can be loaded by your FastAPI backend.

2. Implement the necessary endpoints and logic in `irisfastapp.py` to serve predictions using the trained model. You'll need to define routes that accept input data, make predictions, and return the results.

3. Create a web interface in `Templates/index.html` and style it using the CSS files in `Static/css`. The interface should allow users to input Iris features, submit the data to your FastAPI server, and display the classification results.

4. Document your project in the `README.md` file, providing clear instructions for setting up and running the project.

5. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. Test your project by running the FastAPI server and accessing the web interface through a web browser.

This structure should help you organize your Iris classification project effectively. Make sure to tailor it to your specific needs and requirements.
